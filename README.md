# Simple Website Change Detection

A simple GitHub action that runs weekly and checks if websites or part of websites changed.
If that's the case, the GitHub action fails and I will be notified (there is a setting in the GitHub app to get notification if an action fails).

If you want to use it for yourself, just fork the repo or copy the code and add your own websites and change conditions.
